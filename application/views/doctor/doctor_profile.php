                            I couldn't recommend an office more! They are all so awesome and provide a really customized plan to fix whatever issue you're facing. I had some issues with my neck/back and have seen Rich for physical therapy, their chiropractor, a sports medicine doctor, a massage therapist and soon to be a trainer to help get me back into the condition I need -- All covered through the one visit. Amazing experience, they are doing it right!
